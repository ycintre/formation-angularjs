# Why?
In Javascript, a boolean operations are evaluated from left to right and return the last evaluated term.  
This can be counter-intuitive as we may think that a boolean operation will only return a boolean value. 


# Good to know
The function declaration is evaluated as `truthy`.  
The `console.log(b);` in the function is not executed as the function is only declared and not executed.
